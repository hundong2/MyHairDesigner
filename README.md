AI-powered Personal Hair Styling & Salon Finder Application.

## 🚀 Project Roadmap

We are building a "World Class" application focusing on Impact, Technical Depth, Creativity, and Presentation.

### Phase 1: AI Face Analysis & Personalization (Complete)
- [x] **Face Shape Detection**: Use Gemini Vision to analyze user's face shape (Oval, Round, Square, etc.) from uploaded photo.
- [x] **Smart Recommendation**: Suggest specific hairstyles from our catalog that suit the user's face shape.
- [x] **Visual Cues**: Highlight "Best Match" styles in the UI.

### Phase 2: UX & Guidance System (Complete)
- [x] **Smart Stylist Guide**: Added a dynamic progress bar with context-aware tips ("💡 Pro Tip") to guide users through the process.
- [x] **Interactive Chat**: After generating the image, allow users to ask follow-up questions about care and maintenance.

### Phase 3: Technical Depth & Polish (Complete)
- [x] **Deep Hair Consultation**: The interactive chat provides reasoning on why the style suits the user and how to maintain it.
- [x] **Before/After Comparison**: Hold-to-compare button added to the result view for clear transformation visualization.
- [x] **Social Sharing**: Generated a beautiful "Style Card" component for social sharing with `navigator.share` integration.
- [x] **Performance**: Optimized image upload process by implementing client-side resizing (`1024px` limit) to ensure fast AI processing.
