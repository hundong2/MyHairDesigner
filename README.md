# Own my hair Designer 💇‍♀️✨

AI-powered Personal Hair Styling & Salon Finder Application.

## 🚀 Project Roadmap

We are building a "World Class" application focusing on Impact, Technical Depth, Creativity, and Presentation.

### Phase 1: AI Face Analysis & Personalization (Current Step)
- [x] **Face Shape Detection**: Use Gemini Vision to analyze user's face shape (Oval, Round, Square, etc.) from uploaded photo.
- [x] **Smart Recommendation**: Suggest specific hairstyles from our catalog that suit the user's face shape.
- [x] **Visual Cues**: Highlight "Best Match" styles in the UI.

### Phase 2: Deep Styling Consultation (Next Step)
- [ ] **Interactive Chat**: After generating the image, allow users to ask follow-up questions (e.g., "How do I maintain this?", "What products do I need?").
- [ ] **Technical Depth**: Use Gemini's reasoning capabilities to provide specific care instructions based on hair texture.

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization & Polish
- [ ] **Before/After Comparison**: clear visual slider for the transformation.
- [ ] **Social Sharing**: Generate a "Style Card" image to share on social media.
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize image processing and loading states.
